A note taker that allows you to input a title and journal message for future use. App is built with JavaScript Node-Express technologies.

## User Story

Aa a hard-working individual, I need an application that allows me to store notes in an organized way to use in future.

Application will load the index page and press start that will bring user to the notes page where you can update all notes.

User need to input messages with Titles along with content, and an option to delete saved note when ever required.
